Our innovative system, utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller and MAX30102 Pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor module, offers a groundbreaking approach to patient care. This technology enables the continuous monitoring of vital signs, crucial during transitions from high to low acuity environments and beyond.
By harnessing the power of 5G, we ensure real-time data aggregation and analysis, providing healthcare providers with remote access to critical patient information. This allows for informed decisions regarding hospital admission or discharge, enhancing patient care and safety. Data of vitals is seamlessly transmitted and displayed using the Blynk software, presenting a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring within the hospital setting.
